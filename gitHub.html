        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>It is an open source version control software. Version control is a system that records changes to a
            file or set of files over time so that you can keep track of the activities you performed.</p>
        
        <p>In Real life projects, multiple developers work parallelly. So they need a version 
           control system like Git to make sure that there are no code conflicts between them.</p>

        <h2>Why do we need it?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Git makes it easy to contribute to open source projects:</li>
            <p>If you want to contribute to other's projects, you just fork(get a copy of) the project, make your changes, and then make a pull request to the project owner using GitHub's web interface. This way project owner can look into your changes and include these changes in his/her project. </p>

            <li>To track changes in your code:</li>
            <p>When multiple people work on a project, itâ€™s hard to keep track of the changes â€” who changed 
                what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository.</p>

            <li>To showcase your work</li>
            <p>Are you someone who wants to attract recruiters? GitHub is the best tool you can rely on for this. You will have a higher chance of being recruited if you have maintained a good github account.
            </p>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Set up your GitHub account</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a GitHub account:
            </li>
        
            <img class="img-center" src="/images/Github/sign_up.PNG" />
            
            <li>
                Download and Install GitHub Desktop.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git Repositories</h2>
        <p>A repository is a project that contains multiple files. This repository tracks all the changes made to files in your project, building a history over time.</p>
        <p>You can do following actions with a repository.</p>
        <img class="img-center" src="images/Github/newrepo.png" />
        <ol>
            <li>Create a new repository locally</li>
            <p>Create a local repository by filling all the details.</p>
            <img class="img-center" src="images/Github/createrepo.PNG" />

            <li>Clone your repository</li>
            <p>Cloning a GitHub repository creates a local copy of the remote repository. This allows you to make all of your changes locally rather than directly in the source files of the original repository.</p>
            <img class="img-center" src="images/Github/clonerepo.PNG" />
            
            <li>Create an existing repository</li> 
            <p>If you have already created a repository, you can select this option and add the existing repository.</p>
            <img class="img-center" src="images/Github/existingrepo.PNG" />
        </ol>

        <h2>Publishing the Repository</h2>
        <p>After creating a Repository, you can publish this repository to the GitHub web interface.</p>
        <img class="img-center" src="images/Github/publish.PNG" />

        <h2>Git commits</h2>
        <p>Commits are like a snapshot of your work and the changes you have made. It creates a history of every commit you make. This helps in keeping track of the changes you made to the project.</p>
        <img class="img-center" src="images/Github/commit.PNG" />

        <h2>Push your changes to the main branch.</h2>
        <p>After commiting to the changes you have made to the project, you need to push the changes to the main branch.</p>
        <img class="img-center" src="images/Github/push.PNG" />

        <h2>Create a new branch</h2>
        <p>If you want to make a new feature but you are worried about making changes to the main project and spoiling it while implementing the feature. This is where git branches come in.</p>
        <p>Click on the New Branch --> Give a name to the branch --> Create Branch. </p>
        <img class="img-center" src="images/Github/branch.PNG" />

        <img class="img-center" src ="images/Github/createbranch.PNG" />
        <h2>Create a Pull Request</h2>
        <p>If you want to contribute or collaborate with other projects, you need to follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Find a project you want to contribute to</li>
        
            <li>Fork it</li>
            <img class="img-center" src="images/Github/fork.PNG" />
        
            <li>Clone it to your local system</li>
        
            <li>Make a new branch</li>
        
            <li>Make your changes</li>
        
            <li>Push it back to your repository</li>
        
            <li>Click on the Compare button</li>
            <p>After you push the changes you have made to the project, go to your repository on GitHub web interface, click on the Compare button. </p>
            <img class="img-center" src="images/Github/compare.PNG" />
        
            <li>Click on Create pull request to open a new pull request</li>
            <img class="img-center" src="images/Github/pullrequest.PNG" />
        </ol>
